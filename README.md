> In the last year at my Job, I was fortunate that my organization asked me to Interview some candidates. But I am a noob and I didn't knew (I still don't) how to interview someone.
So I read a bunch of online articles, talked with a lot of interviewers and during that research I took notes.
And here I am making it public.

# How to Interview (notes)

1. Introduce yourself, make them confortable, you wan't to sell your organization, Be nice
2. Don't try to prove that you are better than the candidate
3. Candidates might not speak english very well but they can code, and otherwise üòÅ
4. Don't focus on the answer, focus on the thought process
5. Just ask questions and ask follow up questions
6. Define earlier what are you looking in a candidate
7. Take notes
8. You can cut off redundant discussions
9. Don't waste time on basic, stereotypical questions (Like, Tell me something about yourself?)
10. Don't dominate the conversation
11. Don't find a friend, find a candidate
12. No Emotional attachments and decisions
13. Check if this candidate is same or better than the current engineers on the same position?
